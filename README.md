## Project Overview

This project evaluates the performance of two ancient DNA sequencing methods—Twist Bioscience capture assay and 1240k capture assay—using the EAGER dataset. Statistical models including mixed effects and beta regression were used to compare their effectiveness.

For detailed methodology, analysis, results, and discussion, see the attached full project report:

## Dataset Source

The analysis uses the EAGER ancient DNA sequencing dataset, containing sequencing metrics such as SNPs, mapped reads, endogenous DNA percentages, and contamination estimates. The dataset was provided by the project supervisor, Dr. Indu Bala.
