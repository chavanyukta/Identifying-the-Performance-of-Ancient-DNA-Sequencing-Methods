## Project Overview

This project evaluates the performance of two ancient DNA sequencing methods—Twist Bioscience capture assay and 1240k capture assay—using the EAGER dataset. Statistical models including mixed effects and beta regression were used to compare their effectiveness.

For detailed methodology, analysis, results, and discussion, see the attached full project report:
